# Cursed Secret Party
> You've just received an invitation to a party. Authorities have reported that the party is cursed, and the guests are trapped in a never-ending unsolvable murder mystery party. Can you investigate further and try to save everyone?

## Solution

Looking through the provided source code, we see a `bot.js` file which reads the flag.txt file.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const JWTHelper = require('./helpers/JWTHelper');
const flag = fs.readFileSync('/flag.txt', 'utf8');
```
The `visit` function opens a browser page and sets a `JWT` token as a cookie. The flag is passed in said token. So we obviously need to steal the bot's cookie to get the flag.

```javascript
const visit = async () => {
    try {
		const browser = await puppeteer.launch(browser_options);
		let context = await browser.createIncognitoBrowserContext();
		let page = await context.newPage();

		let token = await JWTHelper.sign({ username: 'admin', user_role: 'admin', flag: flag });
		await page.setCookie({
			name: 'session',
			value: token,
			domain: '127.0.0.1:1337'
		});
```
